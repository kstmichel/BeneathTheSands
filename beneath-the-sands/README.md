# Beneath the Sands  

**Beneath the Sands** is a 2D snake-inspired game where you control a sandworm navigating a mysterious desert. Traverse the sands, collect items to grow, and use unique mechanics like burrowing beneath the sand and traveling through portals to avoid your own tail.  

## Features  
- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Grow as you collect objects, but avoid colliding with your tail.  
- **Burrowing Mechanic**: Temporarily go beneath the sands to escape tricky situations.  
- **Portal Travel**: Pass through portals to avoid obstacles or reach new areas.  
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Unique Art Style**: Inspired by Tim Burton's aesthetic with original designs and animations.
