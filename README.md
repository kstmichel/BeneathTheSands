**Beneath the Sands** is a 2D snake-inspired game where you control a sandworm navigating a mysterious desert. Traverse the sands, collect items to grow, and use unique mechanics like burrowing beneath the sand and traveling through portals to avoid your own tail.  

Please note, this game is still a work in progress and currently in its "ugly duckling" phase. Built with React, TypeScript, and Jest for testing, I am actively working on integrating Phaser to evolve this simple React game into a fully realized gaming experience.

The following game features have been implemented and are supported by unit tests:

   ## Current Functionality  
   - **Move Sandworm**: Control the sandworm with the arrow keys found on your keyboard.  
   - **Eat Food**: Collide with a food tile and watch the sandworm increase in length and speed!  
   - **Drops Inventory**: Food is removed from the inventory each time it is added to the board, effectively controlling the number of drops per level.
   - **Next Level**: When all food is eaten and nothing is left in the drop inventory you advance to the next level.

## Upcoming Functionality  
- **Lose Game**: When the sandworm collides with it's own body the game is lost.
- **Try Again**: When the game is lost the user has the ability to restart the game.
- **New Drop Types**: Drops that increase score will be added to the game (coins, rubies).

## Upcoming UI Upgrades
- **Sandworm Sprite**: The sandworm will evolve from simple black-and-white blocks into a fully designed sprite, complete with original animations.
- **Gameboard Design**: The game board will have a stylized design to help immerse the user into this dystopian other-worldy environment.
- **Introduction Screen**: The game will kick off with a captivating introduction, featuring eye-catching artwork designed to draw players into the world of the sandworm from the very first moment.

## Game Concept (WIP)
- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Grow as you collect objects, but avoid colliding with your tail.  
- **Burrowing Mechanic**: Temporarily go beneath the sands to escape tricky situations.  
- **Portal Travel**: End the level by moving sandworm through a fully-charged portal to move on to the next realm.  
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Unique Art Style**: Inspired by Tim Burton's Beetlejuice, the sandworm comes to life with original designs and animations.
